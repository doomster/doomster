- 👋 Hi, I’m @doomster
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, electronics engineering and 3d design.
- 🌱 I’m currently writing in PHP / and can work easily on HTML/CSS, i also write C and Java. Regarding the 3d design part, i have been working with CNC and 3d-Printers for several years, and can effortlessly design parts in Solidworks, Freecad and Fusion360.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that tickles my mind :P i mean everything and anything, from designing parts for a new project to learning a new programming  language. 
-  I am currently working as a freelance Enginnering designer and electronics technician , and just started wasting hours on a torn(game) tool just to help me keep my js/php skills intact!
